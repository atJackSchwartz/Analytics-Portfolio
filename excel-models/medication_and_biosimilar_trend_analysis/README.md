# Medication & Biosimilar Trend Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes **medical benefit drug cost trends from 2018–2021** and evaluates the **financial impact of biosimilars**. The analysis focuses on identifying key drivers of PMPM growth and estimating cost savings from biosimilar adoption.

## Key Questions
- What was the total change in medication cost PMPM from 2018–2021?
- Which medications drove the largest PMPM increases?
- For Entyvio, how much of the cost increase was due to utilization vs. per-patient cost?
- What was the cost impact of biosimilars in 2021 compared to reference product pricing?

## Methods (High Level)
- Aggregated and cleaned multi-year medical benefit drug data (2018–2021)
- Calculated PMPM trends by medication
- Decomposed cost growth into utilization-driven vs. unit-cost-driven effects
- Modeled a counterfactual 2021 scenario with biosimilar utilization priced at reference product costs
