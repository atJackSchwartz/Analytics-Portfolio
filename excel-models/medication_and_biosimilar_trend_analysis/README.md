# Medication & Biosimilar Trend Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes **medical benefit drug cost trends (2018–2021)** and estimates the **financial impact of biosimilars**. The goal is to identify key drivers of PMPM growth and quantify how biosimilar utilization affected 2021 spending.

## Key Questions
- What was the total change in medication cost PMPM from 2018 to 2021?
- Which medications had the largest PMPM increases over that period?
- For Entyvio, how much of the 2021 cost increase was driven by utilization vs. per-patient cost?
- What was the gross cost impact of biosimilars in 2021 versus reference product pricing?

## Methods (High Level)
- Aggregated and cleaned multi-year medical benefit drug data (2018–2021)
- Calculated PMPM trends by medication
- Decomposed cost change into utilization vs. per-patient cost effects
- Modeled a 2021 counterfactual where biosimilar utilization was priced at reference product costs
