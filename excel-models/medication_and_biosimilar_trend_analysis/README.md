# Medication & Biosimilar Trend Analysis (Excel Model + Presentation)

## Overview
This project analyzes **medical benefit drug cost trends from 2018–2021** and evaluates the **financial impact of biosimilars**. The analysis was completed from the perspective of a Research Analyst supporting the Director of Research at the U.S. FDA.

The goal is to identify key drivers of cost growth and quantify how biosimilar adoption affected 2021 spending. 

## Key Questions Answered
- What was the **total change in medication cost PMPM** from 2018 to 2021?
- Which **top 10 medications** had the highest PMPM increases over that period?
- For **Entyvio**, how much of the 2021 cost increase was driven by:
  - increased utilization vs.
  - increased per-patient cost?
- What was the **gross cost impact of biosimilars in 2021**, compared to paying all utilization at reference product prices?

## Methods (High Level)
- Aggregated and cleaned multi-year medical benefit drug data (2018–2021)
- Calculated PMPM trends by medication
- Decomposed cost growth into **utilization vs. unit-cost effects**
- Modeled a **counterfactual 2021 scenario** where biosimilar utilization was paid at reference product per-patient costs
- When multiple reference products existed, used the reference drug with the **highest 2021 patient volume**
