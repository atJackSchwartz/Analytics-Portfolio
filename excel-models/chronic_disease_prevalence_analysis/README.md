# Chronic Disease Prevalence Analysis (Excel Model)

## Overview
This project analyzes **chronic disease prevalence across U.S. states** and examines how prevalence varies by condition and geography. The goal is to identify patterns that could inform public health planning and resource allocation.

The analysis is presented in an Excel model designed for clear comparison and exploratory insights rather than raw data processing.

## Key Questions
- How does chronic disease prevalence vary by state?
- Which conditions show the highest overall prevalence?
- Are there observable geographic patterns in disease burden?
- Which states consistently rank high or low across multiple conditions?

## Methods (High Level)
- Cleaned and standardized chronic disease prevalence data in Excel
- Aggregated prevalence metrics at the state and condition level
- Used summary tables and visualizations to compare trends
- Highlighted outliers and cross-condition patterns

## Files
- `chronic_disease_prevalence_analysis.xlsx` — Excel workbook containing analysis, tables, and charts
- `README.md` — Project overview and methodology

## How to Use
1. Open the Excel workbook
2. Review summary tables and charts for state-level comparisons
3. Explore condition-specific tabs for deeper insights

## Notes
- Raw source data is not included in this repository.
- This project was completed as a graduate-level analytics exercise and is intended for portfolio demonstration.
